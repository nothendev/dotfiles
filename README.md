## Neovim setup

I use a heavily modified version of NvChad (editing the core folder which is not
recommended but I do not care).

I have my own theme called "Acid Green Fanta" (idk why fanta, a friend told me
to name it that), which is just a darker version of Github Dark (which I really
like).

## Hyprland setup

I use Hyprland as my window manager because it is Wayland and because it is
awesomely beautiful.

My Hyprland config is just a slightly modified version of the default one, with
my own keybinds and additional fluff for Nvidia.
